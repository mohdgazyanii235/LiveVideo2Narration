# Live Video To Narration
Welcome to the "Live Video To Narration" project, an interactive experience that combines the power of AI with the charm of Morgan Freeman's narration. This project captures snapshots from your webcam feed and uses advanced AI to provide a live narration of the scene, mimicking the style of the beloved actor's iconic voice.

## Overview
Our ReactJS-based application taps into the webcam, periodically taking snapshots. These images are then sent to OpenAI's powerful GPT-4 model, designed to generate descriptive and engaging narrations. We leverage ElevenLabs' technology to convert this text into audio that sounds like Morgan Freeman, providing you with a unique storytelling experience of your surroundings.
